            <h2>Understanding Buffer Overflows</h2>
            <div class="meta">Posted on August 14, 2024 by Your Name</div>
            <p>Buffer overflows are a critical vulnerability in software that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. In this post, we'll explore what buffer overflows are and how they can be mitigated.</p>
            <pre><code>char buffer[10];
strcpy(buffer, "This string is too long!");</code></pre>
            <p>As shown above, when the string exceeds the buffer size, it can lead to unpredictable behavior, often crashing the program or allowing an attacker to execute malicious code.</p>

            <h2>CTF Writeup: XYZ Challenge</h2>
            <div class="meta">Posted on August 10, 2024 by Your Name</div>
            <p>The XYZ CTF challenge was focused on exploiting SQL injections. This post will walk you through the steps I took to solve it and provide insights into the techniques used.</p>
            <pre><code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'password';</code></pre>
            <p>By inputting <code>' OR '1'='1</code>, we can bypass the authentication mechanism, as the condition always returns true, granting access without needing the correct password.</p>

            <h2>Red Team: Initial Access Tactics</h2>
            <div class="meta">Posted on August 1, 2024 by Your Name</div>
            <p>In this post, we'll delve into some common tactics used by red teams to gain initial access to a target system. From phishing to exploiting vulnerable services, understanding these methods is crucial for defense.</p>
            <p>One popular method is spear phishing, where a targeted email is sent to the victim, tricking them into revealing credentials or downloading malicious software.</p>
